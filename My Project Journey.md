This is the ending of the first ever project i had created with the Software Engineering team at My University.

This corrisponds with my course as at the time of planning the project we were being taught about decimal to binary conversion.
Orignally i wanted to do something with vibrations however after thinking about the practicalities of this, i realised that it wouldnt work
as you need to be able to physically see the 1s and 0s (on and off, in this case) 

i first started with doing the blink exercise as this allowed me to get used to some of the syntax of the coding language c++.
I then moved onto doing a latched button press which allowed me to implement a changing state which needs to be checked.

after this i started to do the mathematic conversions on the back end, and then this was when i was introduced to using the "Serial Monitor" and as input and output.
Once I had done this i was then moving on to using a GUI, This was something i had looking into whilst in college, using the TKinter libary in python. 
When it had come to making the 2 interact, i had to ask the member of staff which over sees the SE Team to help which helped me to understnad that i had to comment out the
"While" statement which then allowed it to work, There is a video of it below
